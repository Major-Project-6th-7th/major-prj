# AI-Driven Resource Optimizer for Construction Schedules 🏗️🤖

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a command-line tool that uses Artificial Intelligence to optimize resource allocation (labor, materials, equipment) for construction project schedules. It aims to **reduce delays, minimize costs**, and even **estimate carbon footprints**, helping construction managers make smarter and more sustainable decisions.

## 🎯 Features

- 📁 Accepts input in JSON/CSV formats (tasks, resources, constraints)
- 🧬 Uses **Genetic Algorithms (DEAP)** or **Reinforcement Learning (OpenAI Gym)** for schedule optimization
- 💸 Generates cost-efficient and time-optimized schedules
- 🌱 Estimates **carbon emissions** based on resource usage
- 📊 Outputs easy-to-read schedules and resource breakdowns
- ⚙️ Optional analysis mode for evaluating existing project schedules

## 🚀 Sample CLI Usage

```bash
python resource_optimizer.py optimize --input bridge_project.csv --max-cost 150000 --eco-mode
